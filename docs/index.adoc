== Technical Reference

=== The HTTP Driver

The HTTP driver uses the existing (since Neo4j 2.x) transaction Cypher HTTP API, and is implemented using `Apache Commons httpclient` and `Jackson` for JSON (de)serialization.

The JDBC URL has this format: `jdbc:neo4j:http://host:port/?username=neo4j,password=xxxx`

=== The Bolt Driver

The Bolt driver connects to any Neo4j 3.x database that has the binary "Bolt" transport enabled.

It uses the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[neo4j-java-driver] to provide the connectivity.

Just provide your username and password and you can connect to Neo4j.

The JDBC URL has this format: `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://host:port/?username=neo4j,password=xxxx`

=== The Bolt+Routing Driver

Starting from version 3.3.1, the JDBC driver brings with it the bolt+routing protocol.

Again, it uses the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[neo4j-java-driver] to provide the connectivity.

If you're connecting to a Neo4j Causal Cluster the JDBC URL has this format:

`jdbc:neo4j:bolt+routing://host:port/?username=neo4j,password=xxxx`

The address in the URL must be that of a Core server.

==== Routing Context

Routing driver with routing context is an available option with a Neo4j Causal Cluster of version 3.2 or above.

In such a setup, you can include a preferred routing context via the parameter `routingcontext`.

`jdbc:neo4j:bolt+routing://host:port?username=neo4j,password=xxxx,routingcontext=region=eu&country=it`

The address in the URL must be that of a Core server.

==== Access Mode (READ, WRITE)

In order to start a transaction in read or write mode just use the `Connection#setReadOnly` method.

Be aware not to invoke it while the transaction is open otherwise the driver will raise an SQLException.

If you're accessing to a Neo4j Causal Cluster, by calling this method write operations will be forwarded to CORE instances,
while read operations will be managed by READ REPLICA nodes.

==== Bookmarks

When working with a causal cluster, causal chaining is carried out by passing bookmarks between transactions in a session (see https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/3.2/drivers/sessions-transactions/#driver-transactions-causal-chaining[causal chaining]).

The JDBC driver allows you to read bookmarks by calling the following method:

`connection.getClientInfo(BoltRoutingNeo4jDriver.BOOKMARK);`

Also you can set the bookmark by calling the corresponding method:

`connection.setClientInfo(BoltRoutingNeo4jDriver.BOOKMARK, "my bookmark");`

==== Bolt+Routing with Bookmark Example

.Run Query
[source,java]
----
String connectionUrl = "jdbc:neo4j:bolt+routing://localhost:7687?noSsl";

try  (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl, "neo4j", password)) {
    connection.setAutoCommit(false);

    // Access to CORE nodes, as the connection is opened by default in write mode
    try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
        statement.execute("create (:BoltRoutingTest { protocol: 'BOLT+ROUTING' })");
    }

    // closing transaction before changing access mode
    connection.commit();

    // printing the transaction bookmark
    String bookmark = connection.getClientInfo(BoltRoutingNeo4jDriver.BOOKMARK);
    System.out.println(bookmark);

    // Switching to read-only mode to access READ REPLICA nodes
    connection.setReadOnly(true);

    try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
        try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("match (t:BoltRoutingTest) return count(t) as tot")) {
            if (resultSet.next()) {
                Long tot = resultSet.getLong("tot");
            }
        }
    }

    connection.commit();
}

=== JDBC Compatibility

We cover these aspects of the JDBC-APIs, everything that's not explicitely mentioned should be assumed to be not implemented:

* Driver handling automatic loading and JDBC URLs
* Connection, incl. autocommit and manual commit
* Read-only and write transactions
* Statements for reads and writes
* PreparedStatement for reads and writes, including parameters, both question marks `?` and named numbered parameters `{1}`
* ResultSet retrieving all columns as String, Object and their native type with optional conversions
